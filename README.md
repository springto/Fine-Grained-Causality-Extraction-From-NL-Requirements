# Fine-Grained Causality Extraction From Natural Language Requirements Using Recursive Neural Tensor Networks

Replication Package containing:

a) The code of the trained RNTN (see folder RNTN)

b) The code of our tree exporter (see folder Annotation Exporter)

c) The adapted code of the brat annotation platform (see folder brat)

d) The "Causality Treebank": the first corpus of fully labeled binary parse trees representing the composition of causal relations in NL requirements. Specifically, we annotated the composition of 1,571 causal requirements on the basis of 27 different segment labels (e.g., causes, conditions, conjunctions). You can find the corpus under RNTN/trees.
